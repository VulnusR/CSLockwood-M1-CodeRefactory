# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
This repo is for the UCLA fullstack program bootcamp, module 1. <br>
This assignment was to refactory code to make it more efficent and to demonstrate an understanding of best practices of HTML and CSS. <br>
The module 1 assignment procided the following as a guideline and criteria for the assignment:

### User Story
AS A marketing agency <br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards <br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines<br>

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards<br>
WHEN I view the source code<br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning <br>
WHEN I view the image elements<br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br>
THEN they fall in sequential order<br>
WHEN I view the title element<br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br>

### Changes Made
1) Fixed page title
2) HTML Optimized - Divs replaced with semantic HTML elements, as well as formatting/spacing changes to be more in line with HTML best practices. 
3) Inserted ALT text for images to bring the webpage in line with disability standards.
4) Altered CSS and respective HTML classes to prevent excess code -- an elimination of reduncies.
